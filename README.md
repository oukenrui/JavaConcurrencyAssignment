# JavaConcurrencyAssignment
I made a java application that simulates factory operation for a homework assignment. Read "A6-2018.pdf" and "A6 Writeup.pdf" for more details.

Compilation Instructions (after cloning):
To compile these files, at the command line type: “javac *.java”. You may need to run an additional command between subsequent runs of this application: rm *.class. To execute the program, you’ll need to two terminal windows. First, in one terminal run the following command: java Server. In another terminal, run: java JobSim. To stop the application press Ctrl+C in each terminal window (stopping Server.class first is recommended).
